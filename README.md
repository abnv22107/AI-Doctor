# ðŸ§  AI-Doctor

AI-Doctor is a medical reasoning assistant powered by the **DeepSeek-R1 Distill LLaMA 8B** model. Fine-tuned using **Unsloth** and medical chain-of-thought (CoT) datasets, AI-Doctor delivers clinical-grade answers with logical reasoning.

This project is part of a larger vision to unify multiple medical AI tools into a single app.
